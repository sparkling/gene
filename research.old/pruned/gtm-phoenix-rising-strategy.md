# Phoenix Rising GTM Strategy (Archived)

**Status:** PRUNED - Phoenix Rising data source removed due to legal/privacy concerns
**Note:** This GTM strategy was based on Phoenix Rising as both a data source and community entry point. With the data source pruned, this strategy needs revision.

## Original Strategy Summary

### Community Entry Point
- **Target:** Phoenix Rising community (ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, Long COVID, POTS, MCAS patients)
- **Rationale:** Passionate early adopters obsessed with methylation who would provide feedback

### Phased Approach
| Phase | Timeline | Focus | Target Users |
|-------|----------|-------|--------------|
| MVP | Months 1-4 | Core features + methylation focus | Phoenix Rising early adopters |
| Growth | Months 5-8 | Practitioner portal + TCM expansion | Practitioners + their patients |
| Scale | Months 9-12 | Broad marketing + full feature parity | General biohacker market |

### Partnership Plan
1. Contact forum moderators (Week 1)
2. Offer free Pro accounts to top 20 contributors (Week 2)
3. Create Phoenix Rising-specific SNP collection (Week 3)
4. Launch forum integration (Week 4)

### Marketing Activities
- Phoenix Rising forum launch thread
- Reddit posts (r/MTHFR, r/Supplements, r/Nootropics, r/ChronicIllness)
- Phoenix Rising protocol documentation
- Early adopter discount (50% off annual)

## Why This Strategy Was Pruned

1. **Data Source Issues:** Phoenix Rising forum scraping raises legal/privacy concerns
2. **Platform Dependency:** Relying on a single community creates risk
3. **Scope Creep:** ME/CFS focus may be too narrow for platform viability

## Alternative Approach Needed

Consider replacing with:
- Broader chronic illness community engagement (multiple platforms)
- Practitioner-first B2B2C model
- Direct-to-consumer marketing without platform dependency
