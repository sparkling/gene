### Assumption Challenges

| Assumption | Risk Level | Evidence Gap |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| TCM/Ayurveda opportunity is large | MEDIUM | No TAM/SAM/SOM data |
| Users want interactive pathways | MEDIUM-HIGH | No user research cited |
| Privacy-first attracts users | MEDIUM | May be necessary but not sufficient |
| 40+ databases create moat | HIGH | All public, replicable in 12-18 months |
| Community features succeed | HIGH | Most community attempts fail |

### Execution Risks

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| Database integration complexity | HIGH | Start with 5-7 core databases |
| Regulatory compliance | HIGH | Educational positioning, legal review |
| Competing with SelfDecode scale | MEDIUM | Focus on quality over quantity |

### Confidence Assessment

**Overall: MEDIUM**

| Product-market fit | 40% |
| Sustainable business | 25% |
| Category leader | 10% |

### Recommended Mitigations
1. Validate market size with user research before full build
2. Start with practitioners (B2B) who understand the science
3. Integrate 5-7 core databases first, expand later
4. Build pathway visualization as primary differentiator
5. Defer community features until PMF validated
6. Plan 18-24 month runway

## Conclusion

Gene Platform has identified a genuine market opportunity in the intersection of genetics and traditional medicine. With **ADNTRO as the only competitor** and their offering limited to Ayurveda doshas (not treatments), the market is wide open for a comprehensive multi-modality platform.

**The three winning bets:**
1. Traditional medicine integration is the differentiator
2. Community-first growth (Phoenix Rising beachhead) works
3. Interactive visualization sells

**Critical success factors:**
- Speed to market (18-month window before competitors notice)
- Practitioner validation (B2B2C channel)
- Evidence-based rigor (citations for traditional medicine)
- Community building (SNP collection network effects)

The strategy has **medium confidence** due to market validation uncertainty and execution complexity, but the opportunity is real and defensible with focused execution.
