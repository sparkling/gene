# Competitive Analysis: Genetics/SNP Health Platforms

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive competitive research for the Gene Platform - a genetics-based health optimization platform connecting SNPs, genes, biochemical pathways, and multiple treatment modalities (pharmaceuticals, supplements, TCM, Ayurveda, herbal medicine).

**Total Platforms Analyzed**: 100+
**Research Date**: January 2026

**Key Finding**: No existing platform combines all of Gene Platform's planned features:
- Multi-treatment modality integration (pharma + TCM + Ayurveda + herbal)
- Interactive biochemical pathway visualization linked to personal genetics
- Privacy-first anonymous sharing model
- Self-learning vector intelligence (RuVector)
- Community-driven SNP collections

**Critical Discovery**: ADNTRO (Spain) is the only platform offering Ayurveda dosha + genetics analysis. This validates demand but shows the market is wide open for comprehensive traditional medicine + genetics integration.

## Deep Analysis: Key Competitors

### 1. SelfHacked + SelfDecode Ecosystem

**Two related but distinct platforms - must understand both.**

#### SelfHacked (selfhacked.com) - Content/Education Platform

**Founded by Joe Cohen** (biohacker who recovered from chronic illness through self-experimentation).

- **Type**: Health content website/encyclopedia
- **Content**: Supplements, biohacking, genetics, lab markers
- **Unique Approach**:
  - Nearly all citations from PubMed peer-reviewed studies
  - Clear evidence categorization (clinical vs animal vs cell studies)
  - Science team includes MDs, PhDs, pharmacists
  - Extensive gene/SNP articles (e.g., "Genes and SNPs Related to Dopamine Function")
- **Pricing**: Now paywalled - requires SelfDecode subscription for full access (previously free)
- **Strengths**: Strict sourcing standards, authentic biohacker origin story, comprehensive substance profiles
- **Weaknesses**: Articles now paywalled, no personalization without SelfDecode

**Key Insight for Gene Platform**: SelfHacked's citation system and evidence categorization is a model for presenting research. Consider similar approach for intervention evidence.

---

#### SelfDecode (selfdecode.com) - DNA Analysis Platform

**The benchmark for comprehensiveness.**

- **Features**: 1,500+ reports, 200M+ variants (imputed), AI Health Coach (DecodyGPT), polygenic risk scores, pathway analysis, labs integration, PGx
- **Pricing**: $199-899 DNA kits; $99/yr subscription; $119.88/yr for DecodyGPT
- **Unique Technology**:
  - Ancestry-adjusted PRS (only DTC company offering this)
  - AI imputation to 83M variants from consumer tests
  - Integrated ecosystem: Content + DNA + Labs + AI + Custom Supplements
  - Personalized blog posts based on genetics
- **Strengths**: Most variants, HIPAA/GDPR, published PRS algorithms, full-stack platform
- **Weaknesses**: Complex UI, can't see actual SNPs, generic recommendations, spam emails, premium insights only for direct tests

**Key Insight**: SelfDecode proves the market wants comprehensive analysis but struggles with usability. **Opportunity: Better UX with similar depth, plus TCM/Ayurveda integration they lack.**

---

### 2. StrateGene (seekinghealth.com/strategene) - Visualization Inspiration

**Primary inspiration for pathway visualization.**

- **Features**: 98 genes, 206 SNPs, visual biochemical pathway diagrams, 9 key pathways
- **Pricing**: $95 upload; ~$285 with kit
- **Pathway Diagrams**: Illustrated charts with arrows showing metabolic flow, colored enzyme symbols, Fast/Slow/Intermediate classifications
- **Strengths**: Pathway-centric approach, Dr. Ben Lynch expertise, visual learning
- **Weaknesses**: Only 147 SNPs, static PDFs (not interactive), no citations, supplement company conflict

**Key Insight**: StrateGene's approach is powerful but dated. **Opportunity: Interactive, web-based pathway diagrams with more SNPs and evidence citations.**

---

### 3. LiveWello (livewello.com) - Community Sharing Model

**Key inspiration for SNP collections/sharing feature.**

- **Features**: 600K SNPs for $19.95, SNP Sandbox tool, Gene Library (community templates), GWAS tools
- **SNP Collections Workflow**:
  1. User creates custom report with chosen rsIDs
  2. Clicks "Share to Library" (shares template, NOT personal data)
  3. Others can use template to auto-generate their own report
  4. Community library grows organically
- **Strengths**: Affordable, community-driven, user-controlled sharing
- **Weaknesses**: Dated UI, no explanations, web-only

**Key Insight**: LiveWello's community sharing model is exactly what's needed. **Adopt SNP collection concept with modern UX and anonymous publishing.**

---

### 4. ADNTRO (adntro.com) - ONLY Ayurveda + Genetics Platform

**Critical discovery - validates traditional medicine + genetics market.**

- **Location**: Palma De Mallorca, Spain (founded 2019)
- **Features**: 750K SNPs analyzed, imputes to 12M+ markers, **Ayurveda dosha analysis** in Labs section
- **Ayurveda Approach**: Associates genetic predisposition to doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) based on scientific studies
- **Other Features**: Sleep, aging, telomere length, skin aging, pharmacogenetics
- **Recognition**: Top 10 Biotech Companies 2022 (Life Sciences Review)

**Key Insight**: ADNTRO proves there's demand for traditional medicine + genetics integration. They only do Ayurveda doshas - Gene Platform can go much deeper with TCM, Ayurveda treatments, Kampo, etc.

---

### 5. Epigenetics Leaders: TruDiagnostic & Elysium

**TruDiagnostic** ($499):
- 900,000+ methylation markers
- OMICmAge (Harvard) - most predictive aging algorithm
- SYMPHONYAge (Yale) - 11 organ system aging scores
- 75+ longevity biomarkers

**Elysium Index** ($299-499):
- 9 system ages (brain, heart, metabolic, immune)
- APEX platform from Yale's Morgan Levine
- 0-1.5 year deviation (vs 3-9 years for others)

**Key Insight**: Biological age testing is premium market. Consider integration path for Gene Platform.

---

### 6. Phoenix Rising Forum - Community Knowledge

**Richest source of methylation/SNP treatment protocols.**

- **Focus**: ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, Long COVID, POTS, MCAS
- **Key SNPs Discussed**: MTHFR, CBS, COMT, GCH1, NOS, BHMT, glutathione genes
- **Popular Protocols**:
  1. Freddd's Protocol (gradual methylation support)
  2. Rich Van Konynenburg's Simplified Protocol
  3. Dr. Chris Masterjohn's Protocol (creatine + phosphatidylcholine)
  4. Amy Yasko's Protocol (TMG + BHMT pathway)

**Key Insight**: Rich community knowledge trapped in forum threads. **Opportunity: Aggregate and structure this knowledge systematically.**

## Competitive Gaps = Gene Platform Opportunities

### 1. No Multi-Treatment Modality Integration
**Gap**: ADNTRO does Ayurveda doshas only. No platform connects genetics to actual TCM/Ayurveda/Kampo treatments.
**Opportunity**: Gene Platform's unique integration of 40+ databases spanning treatment traditions.

### 2. Static Pathway Visualization
**Gap**: StrateGene's pathways are static PDFs.
**Opportunity**: Interactive Cytoscape.js-based pathway diagrams with zoom, filtering, personal SNP overlay.

### 3. No Structured Community Knowledge
**Gap**: Phoenix Rising knowledge trapped in forum threads.
**Opportunity**: Structured protocol library with SNP collections.

### 4. Poor Evidence Linking
**Gap**: Most platforms make recommendations without proper citations.
**Opportunity**: Every recommendation linked to PubMed with evidence grades.

### 5. Privacy vs Features Tradeoff
**Gap**: Great privacy (Genetic Lifehacks) OR great features (SelfDecode), not both.
**Opportunity**: Privacy-first with opt-in anonymous sharing.
