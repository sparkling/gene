# Competitive Landscape

**Document ID:** 23-COMPETITORS

## TL;DR

The competitive landscape spans 10 tiers from direct genetics competitors to practitioner platforms. Key finding: NO competitor connects genetics to traditional medicine TREATMENTS. SelfDecode leads in genetics (200M+ variants), StrateGene owns practitioner trust with pathway visualization, but both ignore 5,000+ years of TCM/Ayurveda/Kampo wisdom. This gap is our blue ocean opportunity.

## Key Competitor Analysis

### Tier 1: SelfDecode (Primary Competitor)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Strengths** | 200M+ variants, comprehensive, AI coach (DecodyGPT), full ecosystem |
| **Weaknesses** | Complex UI, no traditional medicine, expensive ($199-899), supplement-pushy |
| **Threat Level** | HIGH |
| **What We Learn** | Comprehensiveness matters, but not at cost of UX |
| **Our Advantage** | Multi-modal knowledge (TCM/Ayurveda/Kampo), cleaner interface |

### Tier 1: StrateGene (Primary Competitor)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Strengths** | Beautiful pathway diagrams, Dr. Ben Lynch credibility, practitioner-trusted |
| **Weaknesses** | Static PDFs, only ~200 SNPs, no traditional medicine, owned by supplement company |
| **Threat Level** | HIGH |
| **What We Learn** | Visualization SELLS. Making biochemistry visual is powerful. |
| **Our Advantage** | Interactive (not static), 10x SNP coverage, no supplement bias |

### Tier 1: LiveWello

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Strengths** | Privacy-preserving template sharing, $20 one-time, SNP sandbox tool |
| **Weaknesses** | Dated UI, no interpretation, stalled development |
| **Threat Level** | MEDIUM |
| **What We Learn** | Community template model is powerful but poorly executed |
| **Our Advantage** | Modern UX, AI interpretation, active development |

### Tier 8: ADNTRO (Only Traditional Medicine Competitor)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Strengths** | Only platform with Ayurveda + genetics (doshas), European focus |
| **Weaknesses** | Doshas only (not treatments), no TCM, no Kampo, limited SNPs |
| **Threat Level** | LOW (but validates market) |
| **What We Learn** | Demand exists for traditional medicine + genetics |
| **Our Advantage** | Full treatments (not just constitution), THREE WORLDS complete |
