| **Differentiation** | Multi-modal treatment integration | Only platform with TCM + Ayurveda + genetics |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Market Timing is Favorable**: 20%+ CAGR across all segments; 23andMe disruption creates vacuum

2. **Blue Ocean Exists**: Traditional medicine + genetics is virtually untapped ($200B+ market with zero serious entrants)

3. **Freemium Works**: Genetic Genie model proves free methylation reports drive traffic; monetize with advanced features

4. **Subscription is the Future**: One-time purchases shifting to recurring revenue models

5. **Multi-omic Convergence**: Leading platforms adding blood, microbiome, CGM; Gene Platform should plan integration paths

6. **Practitioner Channel is Profitable**: B2B2C margins higher; consider practitioner tier for Phase 2
