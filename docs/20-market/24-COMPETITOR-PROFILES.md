## TL;DR

Deep analysis of 8 key competitors across 4 tiers. Primary threats: SelfDecode (comprehensive genetics, DecodyGPT) and StrateGene (practitioner trust, pathway visualization). Key inspiration: StrateGene's pathway-centric approach proves visual biochemistry sells. Critical gap across ALL competitors: no platform integrates genetics with traditional medicine treatments. ADNTRO only does Ayurvedic doshas, not herb-gene-condition mapping. This gap defines our differentiation.

| **Funding** | Venture-backed (~$5M) |
| **Employees** | 20-50 estimated |
| **Pricing** | $200-400 |
| **SNP Coverage** | 12M+ (via imputation) |
| **Key Features** | Ayurveda doshas, sports genetics, nutrition |

**Strengths:**
- **Only competitor with Ayurveda integration**
- Modern, clean UI
- European market presence
- Broad report types (ancestry, sports, nutrition)
- Imputation to 12M+ variants

**Weaknesses:**
- Ayurveda limited to dosha typing only (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)
- No herb-gene-condition mapping
- No TCM or Kampo
- No AI chat
- Limited community features
- European focus (limited US presence)
- No practitioner marketplace

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Validates demand for genetics + traditional medicine**
- Their dosha-only approach is surface-level
- Opportunity: go deeper with herb-gene mapping
- First mover claim at risk if they expand

**Critical Gap:**
ADNTRO proves the market wants Ayurveda + genetics. But they stop at doshas. We go deeper: specific herbs, formulas, and conditions mapped to genetic variants.
