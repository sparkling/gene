## TL;DR

Combined TAM exceeds $220B across genetics ($3B→$22B) and traditional medicine ($214B→$359B). The platform's unique opportunity lies in the blue ocean intersection — no competitor connects genetics to traditional medicine treatments. SAM focuses on 10M+ active health seekers with genetic data. SOM targets 10,000 users in Year 1 from chronic illness communities.
