## TL;DR

Value proposition scored 8.8/10 using McKinsey framework: "If conventional medicine has left you without answers, we built this for you. We are the only platform connecting your genetics, labs, symptoms, and lifestyle to every medical tradition. Ask questions and discover what works for your body." VP adds purchase argument beyond mission: emotional hook ("left without answers"), explicit differentiation ("only platform"), and mechanism ("ask questions, discover").

## Purpose of a Value Proposition

The VP answers: **"Why should I buy from YOU instead of competitors?"**

| Layer | Question Answered | Audience |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| Vision | "What future are we building?" | Everyone (inspirational) |
| Mission | "What does the company DO?" | Employees, investors (directional) |
| **Value Prop** | "Why should I choose YOU?" | **Customers making purchase decisions** |

The VP is the **sales argument**. It converts consideration to action.

## McKinsey VP Framework

A strong value proposition has three components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **1. Target Customer** | Specific segment with specific pain/need |
| **2. Differentiated Benefit** | Outcome they care about that competitors DON'T provide |
| **3. Proof/Reason to Believe** | Evidence, mechanism, or credibility signal |

**McKinsey Formula:**
> FOR [target customer segment] WHO [has this problem/need], OUR [product] IS THE ONLY [category] THAT [provides this unique benefit] BECAUSE [proof/reason to believe].

---

## Final Value Proposition ✅

> **If conventional medicine has left you without answers, we built this for you. We are the only platform connecting your genetics, labs, symptoms, and lifestyle to every medical tradition. Ask questions and discover what works for your body.**
