## TL;DR

The platform bridges THREE WORLDS that have never been connected: modern genetics, traditional medicine, and nutritional science. We serve "the unhelped" — people failed by conventional medicine — with a four-sided marketplace that unites personal biology with global healing wisdom and community support. No competitor spans all three domains.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale | Date |
|----------|--------|-----------|------|
| Target segment | "The Unhelped" | Sharp focus enables strong positioning | Jan 2026 |
| Platform model | Four-sided marketplace | Network effects + recurring revenue | Jan 2026 |
| Positioning | THREE WORLDS bridge | No competitor connects all three domains | Jan 2026 |
| AI placement | Value Prop, not Mission | Too technology-specific, may not age well | Jan 2026 |

## The Opportunity

**Market Gap:** No platform connects genetics to traditional medicine TREATMENTS (not just constitutional typing). Competitors focus on Western supplements while ignoring 5,000+ years of global healing wisdom.

**Market Size:**
- DTC Genetic Testing: $2.5B (2025) → $6-22B (2030), 20-24% CAGR
- Consumer Genomics: $3.0B → $22.6B, 24.9% CAGR
- Traditional Medicine: $214B → $359B, 7.7% CAGR
- TCM + Genetics Intersection: ~$50M → ~$500M (Blue Ocean)
