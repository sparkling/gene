## TL;DR

Six revenue streams across two categories: **Recurring** (subscriptions for clients and practitioners) and **Transactional** (marketplace fees, affiliate commissions). Year 1 target: $300K ARR primarily from subscriptions. Year 3 target: $5M ARR with marketplace transactions becoming dominant. Key insight: subscriptions provide predictable base, marketplace provides scalable upside.
