## TL;DR

Four-tier pricing structure: Free ($0), Gene Report ($19 one-time), Gene Annual ($79/year), Gene Pro ($179/year). Positioned below SelfDecode ($199-899) and above Promethease ($12). Strategy: accessible entry, value-based upgrades, premium for AI features. Free tier is acquisition funnel, not freemium trap. Practitioner pricing separate ($49-299/year).
