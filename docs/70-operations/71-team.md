## TL;DR

Founder-led team building a platform from deep personal experience with chronic illness. The founder's 10-year Ankylosing Spondylitis journey — including extensive genetic research, self-experimentation, and significant personal cost — drives the mission to help "the unhelped" with an affordable, comprehensive platform that no one else provides.

## Founder's Motivation

The platform emerges from a deeply personal journey:

### The 10-Year Journey

| Aspect | Experience |
|--------|------------|
| **Condition** | Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) |
| **Duration** | 10+ years of investigation |
| **Approach** | Massive genetic research and self-experimentation |
| **Outcome** | Significant success through addressing underlying causes |
| **Cost** | Considerable financial, social, and emotional investment |

### Key Insights Gained

1. **Conventional Medicine Limitations** — Deep understanding of being failed by the conventional healthcare system
2. **Multi-Modality Value** — Traditional medicine approaches provided insights conventional medicine missed
3. **Genetics as Map** — Personal genetic data served as a roadmap for investigation
4. **Community Need** — Others in similar situations need affordable access to these insights

### Personal Mission

> **Help all the unhelped. Provide a superior platform and community that is affordable to everyone.**

This mission directly shapes:
- **Pricing strategy** — Must be accessible, not just profitable
- **Feature priorities** — Community features are core, not add-ons
- **Target audience** — Those failed by conventional medicine ("the unhelped")
- **Knowledge depth** — Surface-level answers aren't enough
