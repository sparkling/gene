# Health Domains

This directory contains domain-specific views that organize genetic databases by health application areas. These documents aggregate and reference databases from the primary storage locations, providing health-focused perspectives on genetic variants, interventions, and research.

**Important**: Domain documents are "view" documents that reference databases by application area, not primary data storage.

## Available Domains

| Domain | Description | Link |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Mental & Cognitive Health | Neurodevelopmental conditions, psychiatric disorders, cognitive function, neurodegeneration | [mental-cognitive.md](./mental-cognitive.md) |
| Cardiovascular & Metabolic | Heart health, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome | [cardio-metabolic.md](./cardio-metabolic.md) |
| Cancer & Oncology | Cancer susceptibility, tumor genetics, treatment response, prevention | [cancer-oncology.md](./cancer-oncology.md) |
| Autoimmune & Inflammatory | Autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammation, immune system disorders | [autoimmune.md](./autoimmune.md) |
| Rare & Genetic Diseases | Monogenic disorders, rare diseases, genetic syndromes | [rare.md](./rare.md) |
| Women's & Pediatric Health | Reproductive health, pregnancy, pediatric conditions, developmental disorders | [womens-pediatric.md](./womens-pediatric.md) |
| Microbiome & Gut Health | Gut microbiome, digestive disorders, nutrient absorption, gut-brain axis | [microbiome.md](./microbiome.md) |
| Allergy & Pain Management | Allergies, sensitivities, pain syndromes, inflammatory pain | [allergy-pain.md](./allergy-pain.md) |
| Sleep, Longevity & Nutrition | Sleep disorders, aging, longevity pathways, nutritional genomics | [sleep-longevity-nutri.md](./sleep-longevity-nutri.md) |
| Oral, Skin & Sensory Health | Dental health, skin conditions, vision, hearing, sensory processing | [oral-skin-sensory.md](./oral-skin-sensory.md) |

## Domain Document Structure

Each domain document typically includes:

1. **Overview** - Domain scope and key areas
2. **Genetic Databases** - References to relevant databases organized by application
3. **Key Genes & Variants** - Important genetic markers for the domain
4. **Clinical Applications** - How genetic information is used clinically
5. **Research Focus** - Current research priorities and emerging areas
6. **Interventions** - Evidence-based interventions relevant to the domain
7. **References** - Links to primary database documents

## Cross-Domain Considerations

Many genetic variants and interventions span domains. For example:

- **Inflammation** affects cardiovascular, autoimmune, and metabolic domains
- **Methylation** impacts mental health, cancer, and aging
- **Oxidative stress** relates to cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and cancer domains

Users should consult multiple domain views when researching complex conditions with multiple system involvement.

## Maintenance

Domain views are updated when:
- New databases are added to primary storage
- Research reveals new domain-specific applications
- Clinical guidelines change for domain-specific interventions
- Cross-domain relationships are identified
