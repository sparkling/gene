# Literature and Knowledge Resources

**Parent:** [Data Sources](../_index.md)

## Overview

This category encompasses scientific literature databases, knowledge bases, identifier mapping services, and regulatory data sources. These resources provide the textual and semantic foundation for biomedical knowledge, enabling literature mining, entity recognition, and cross-database integration.

Literature and knowledge resources are essential for connecting experimental data to published findings, mapping identifiers across databases, and accessing regulatory information about drugs and clinical trials.

## Subcategories

| Subcategory | Description | Sources |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| [8.1 Scientific Literature](./8.1.scientific.literature/_index.md) | Biomedical publication databases | 5 |
| [8.2 Knowledge Bases](./8.2.knowledge.bases/_index.md) | Structured knowledge repositories | 2 |
| [8.3 Identifier Mapping](./8.3.identifier.mapping/_index.md) | Cross-reference and ID conversion services | 3 |
| [8.4 Regulatory & Legal](./8.4.regulatory.legal/_index.md) | Clinical trials and FDA data | 2 |

## Key Integration Points

- **All Categories**: Literature provides citations and evidence for all data types
- **Identifier Mapping**: Essential for cross-database queries
- **Regulatory**: Links compounds to approval status and clinical trials

## Research Applications

1. Systematic literature reviews
2. Text mining and NLP applications
3. Evidence aggregation for assertions
4. Cross-database entity resolution
5. Regulatory intelligence
