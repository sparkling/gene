# Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases

**Category:** [Compounds & Molecules](../../_index.md) > [Natural Products](../_index.md)

## Overview

Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases are authoritative resources compiled by Dr. James A. Duke documenting the chemical constituents of plants and their traditional uses across cultures. Maintained by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, these databases bridge the gap between ethnobotanical knowledge and modern phytochemistry.

The databases provide quantitative data on phytochemical concentrations in specific plant parts, documented biological activities of compounds, and extensive ethnobotanical records linking plants to traditional medicinal uses from cultures worldwide. This combination makes it invaluable for natural product research, ethnopharmacology, and drug discovery from traditional medicine sources.

The data spans from 1992-2016 and represents one of the most comprehensive collections of plant chemistry and traditional use information available in the public domain under CC0 license.

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Indexed Entries | ~49,788 |
| Biological Activities | 1,900+ documented |
| Plant Species | Thousands |
| Coverage Period | 1992-2016 |

## Primary Use Cases

1. **Ethnopharmacological Research** - Connect traditional plant uses to bioactive compounds
2. **Phytochemical Analysis** - Find chemical constituents and concentrations in plants
3. **Drug Discovery** - Identify bioactive compounds from traditionally used plants
4. **Toxicology Studies** - Access LD50 and toxicity data for plant compounds
5. **Natural Product Chemistry** - Explore structure-activity relationships
