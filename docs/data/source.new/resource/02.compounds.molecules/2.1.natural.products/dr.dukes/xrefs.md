## Integration Notes

Dr. Duke's database bridges natural products chemistry and Western herbal medicine traditions. Created by Dr. James Duke at USDA, it documents phytochemicals found in plants with ethnobotanical uses.

**Primary use (Natural Products):** Chemical constituents of plants, biological activities of phytochemicals, structure-activity relationships.

**Secondary use (Western/Global Herbal):** Traditional uses of medicinal plants, ethnobotanical applications, dosage information, safety data.

The database is particularly valuable for connecting specific phytochemicals to their traditional therapeutic applications and identifying plants containing compounds of interest.
