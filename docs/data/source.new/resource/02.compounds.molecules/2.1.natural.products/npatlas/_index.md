# NPAtlas - Natural Products Atlas

**Category:** [Compounds & Molecules](../../_index.md) > [Natural Products](../_index.md)

## Overview

The Natural Products Atlas (NPAtlas) is a curated database of microbial natural products, with a particular emphasis on compounds from bacteria, fungi, and marine microorganisms. The database provides high-quality structural data with comprehensive literature references, organism sources, and compound classification.

NPAtlas distinguishes itself through rigorous manual curation and a focus on microbial secondary metabolites, which represent a major source of bioactive compounds for drug discovery. Each entry includes validated chemical structures, original isolation references, and taxonomic information about the producing organism.

The database is particularly valuable for natural product dereplication, biosynthetic gene cluster analysis, and exploring the chemical diversity of microbial metabolomes.
