# Compound-Target Interactions

**Parent:** [Compounds & Molecules](../_index.md)

## Overview

Compound-target interaction databases catalog measured binding affinities and functional relationships between small molecules and their protein targets. These resources are essential for drug discovery, target identification, and polypharmacology analysis.

Key resources include BindingDB (binding measurements), DGIdb (drug-gene interactions), GtoPdb (IUPHAR pharmacology), and TTD (therapeutic targets). Together they provide comprehensive coverage of compound-target relationships.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [BindingDB](./bindingdb/_index.md) | 1 | Binding affinity database |
| [DGIdb](./dgidb/_index.md) | 1 | Drug-Gene Interaction Database |
| [GtoPdb](./gtopdb/_index.md) | 1 | Guide to Pharmacology |
| [TTD](./ttd/_index.md) | 2 | Therapeutic Target Database |

## Integration Notes

BindingDB provides quantitative binding data (Ki, Kd, IC50). DGIdb aggregates drug-gene interactions from multiple sources. GtoPdb offers expert-curated pharmacology. TTD links targets to diseases and drugs. Cross-reference targets with UniProt IDs for protein annotations.
