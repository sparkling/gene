# DrugBank - Comprehensive Drug Database

**Category:** [Compounds & Molecules](../../_index.md) > [Pharmaceuticals](../_index.md)

## Overview

DrugBank is a comprehensive, freely accessible online database containing detailed drug and drug target information. It combines detailed chemical, pharmacological, and pharmaceutical data with comprehensive drug target (sequence, structure, pathway) information. DrugBank is unique in linking detailed drug data with experimental and computational target data.

The database contains information on approved drugs, experimental drugs, nutraceuticals, and drug targets. Each drug entry includes chemical properties, pharmacology, mechanisms of action, drug interactions, food interactions, and links to clinical trials. Target information includes protein sequences, structures, pathways, and disease associations.

DrugBank serves as a critical resource for drug discovery, clinical practice, and pharmaceutical research, offering both open and commercial access tiers.
