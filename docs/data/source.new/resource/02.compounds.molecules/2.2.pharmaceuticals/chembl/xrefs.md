## Integration Notes

ChEMBL is the primary database for drug discovery bioactivity data, bridging pharmaceutical compounds with their molecular targets.

**Primary use (Pharmaceuticals):** Drug development pipeline, clinical phase information, mechanism of action, drug indications, approved drugs.

**Secondary use (Compound-Target Interactions):** Bioactivity data (IC50, Ki, EC50), target binding, assay results, SAR analysis.

ChEMBL's comprehensive bioactivity data makes it essential for drug discovery, target identification, and understanding compound-target relationships at molecular level.
