# Protein Sequence and Annotation Databases

**Parent:** [Proteins and Molecular Biology](../_index.md)

## Overview

Protein sequence databases provide curated collections of amino acid sequences with functional annotations, domain information, and cross-references. These resources are fundamental for proteomics research, genome annotation, and understanding protein function.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [RefSeq](./refseq/_index.md) | 1 | NCBI Reference Sequence Database |
| [UniProt](./uniprot/_index.md) | 1 | Universal Protein Resource |

## Integration Notes

UniProt provides the gold-standard curated protein database (Swiss-Prot) plus comprehensive TrEMBL. RefSeq offers NCBI's non-redundant reference sequences. Both are essential for genome annotation and protein analysis.
