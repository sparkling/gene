## Integration Notes

CIViC (Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer) provides expert-curated clinical interpretations of cancer variants.

**Primary use (Cancer Genomics):** Somatic variant interpretations, evidence items, clinical significance for cancer variants.

**Secondary use (Cancer Oncology):** Predictive/prognostic/diagnostic evidence, therapy associations, clinical trials, treatment guidelines.

CIViC enables clinical interpretation of tumor sequencing results with crowdsourced, expert-moderated evidence connecting variants to clinical actionability.
