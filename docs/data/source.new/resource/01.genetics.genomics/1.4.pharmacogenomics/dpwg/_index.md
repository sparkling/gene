# DPWG

**Category:** [Genetics & Genomics](../../_index.md) > [Pharmacogenomics](../_index.md)

## Overview

DPWG (Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group) develops pharmacogenetics-based therapeutic recommendations for drug-gene interactions. Operating since 2005, DPWG guidelines are integrated into the Dutch national drug database (G-Standaard) and are used throughout the Netherlands healthcare system.

DPWG guidelines follow a systematic methodology assessing clinical relevance of gene-drug interactions based on published evidence. Recommendations are categorized by urgency (requiring immediate action vs. optional adjustments) and provide specific dosing guidance or alternative drug recommendations.

The guidelines are available through PharmGKB and complement CPIC guidelines, with efforts ongoing to harmonize recommendations between the two organizations. DPWG guidelines are particularly valuable for European clinical implementation.
