# CPIC

**Category:** [Genetics & Genomics](../../_index.md) > [Pharmacogenomics](../_index.md)

## Overview

CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium) is an international consortium that creates freely available, peer-reviewed, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for gene-drug pairs. CPIC guidelines help clinicians translate pharmacogenomic test results into actionable prescribing decisions.

Each CPIC guideline provides gene-specific information, drug-specific dosing recommendations, and clinical decision support resources including allele functionality tables, phenotype-to-diplotype translation, and therapeutic recommendations. Guidelines are regularly updated as new evidence emerges.

CPIC guidelines are developed through collaboration between PharmGKB (curation), CPIC members (guideline development), and clinical experts. The guidelines are designed to be implemented directly into electronic health record systems and clinical decision support tools.
