## Integration Notes

ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) catalogs functional elements in the human genome through large-scale experimental characterization.

**Primary use (Expression Regulation):** Chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, gene expression across cell types.

**Secondary use (Regulatory Networks):** Enhancer-promoter connections, regulatory element annotations, 3D genome organization, transcriptional regulatory networks.

ENCODE data enables understanding of gene regulation in specific cellular contexts, connecting genomic variation to functional consequences through regulatory element annotation.
