# Expression and Regulation

**Parent:** [Genetics & Genomics](../_index.md)

## Overview

Expression and regulation databases catalog relationships between genetic variants, gene expression, and regulatory elements. These resources connect genetic variation to functional effects through expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and regulatory annotations.

Key resources include GTEx (tissue-specific expression), ENCODE (regulatory elements), eQTLGen (blood eQTL meta-analysis), and GWAS Catalog (trait associations). Together they enable functional interpretation of non-coding variants.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [GTEx](./gtex/_index.md) | 1 | Genotype-Tissue Expression |
| [ENCODE](./encode/_index.md) | 1 | Encyclopedia of DNA Elements |
| [eQTLGen](./eqtlgen/_index.md) | 1 | Blood eQTL meta-analysis |
| [GWAS Catalog](./gwas.catalog/_index.md) | 1 | NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog |

## Integration Notes

GTEx provides tissue-specific eQTLs for 49 tissues. ENCODE annotates regulatory elements including enhancers and promoters. eQTLGen offers the largest blood eQTL dataset. GWAS Catalog catalogs trait associations. Use eQTLs to connect GWAS signals to target genes.
