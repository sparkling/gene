## Integration Notes

The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog curates genome-wide association study results, bridging genetic variants with disease/trait associations.

**Primary use (Expression Regulation):** Genetic variants associated with gene expression (eQTLs), regulatory variants, expression traits.

**Secondary use (Disease-Gene Associations):** SNP-trait associations, disease risk variants, effect sizes, population frequencies.

The GWAS Catalog is essential for understanding genetic architecture of complex traits and identifying candidate genes/variants for functional studies.
