# Rare and Orphan Diseases

**Parent:** [Diseases & Phenotypes](../_index.md)

## Overview

Rare and orphan disease databases specialize in conditions affecting small patient populations. These resources support rare disease diagnosis, gene discovery, and therapeutic development for underserved patient communities.

Key resources include Orphanet (European rare disease portal), DECIPHER (developmental disorders), and PanelApp (curated gene panels). Together they provide comprehensive rare disease information and diagnostic support.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [Orphanet](./orphanet/_index.md) | 1 | Rare disease knowledge base |
| [DECIPHER](./decipher/_index.md) | 1 | Developmental disorder database |
| [PanelApp](./panelapp/_index.md) | 1 | Gene panel curation |

## Integration Notes

Orphanet provides the most comprehensive rare disease catalog with prevalence data and expert center listings. DECIPHER focuses on developmental disorders with CNV and phenotype data. PanelApp offers community-curated diagnostic gene panels. Use with HPO for phenotype matching.
