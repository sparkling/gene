# Diseases and Phenotypes

**Parent:** [Data Sources](../_index.md)

## Overview

This category encompasses databases and ontologies that describe human diseases, phenotypes, and their relationships to genes, variants, and other molecular features. These resources are fundamental for disease diagnosis, gene-disease association studies, and understanding disease mechanisms.

Disease and phenotype databases include standardized ontologies (MONDO, HPO, ICD) for consistent disease classification, gene-disease association databases (DisGeNET, Open Targets), and specialized resources for cancer, rare diseases, autoimmune conditions, and neurological disorders. Together they enable systematic disease annotation and computational phenotyping.

The integration of disease ontologies with genetic variants, pathways, and molecular data supports precision medicine approaches, including rare disease diagnosis, cancer precision oncology, and identification of therapeutic targets.

## Key Integration Points

- **Genetics**: Link diseases to causal variants via ClinVar, GWAS Catalog
- **Pathways**: Connect to dysregulated pathways via Reactome, KEGG
- **Compounds**: Associate with therapeutic drugs via DrugBank, ChEMBL
- **Literature**: Cross-reference with PubMed disease associations
- **Phenotypes**: Map symptoms to HPO terms for phenotype matching

## Research Applications

1. Rare disease diagnosis via phenotype matching
2. Gene-disease association discovery
3. Drug repurposing for diseases
4. Cancer precision oncology
5. Biomarker identification
6. Disease subtype classification
