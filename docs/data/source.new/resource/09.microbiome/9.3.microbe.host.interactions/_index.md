# Microbe-Host Interaction Databases

**Parent:** [Microbiome Resources](../_index.md)

## Overview

Microbe-host interaction databases catalog the relationships between microbial species and host physiology, including disease associations, metabolic interactions, and signaling pathways.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [gutMDisorder](./gutmdisorder/_index.md) | 2 | Gut microbiota-disease associations |
| [MASI](./masi/_index.md) | 2 | Microbiome-associated signaling interactions |
| [VMH](./vmh/_index.md) | 1 | Virtual Metabolic Human |

## Integration Notes

VMH provides metabolic models for microbe-host interactions. gutMDisorder catalogs disease associations. MASI focuses on signaling pathways. Link to pathway databases for mechanistic context.
