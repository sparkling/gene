# Regulatory Networks

**Parent:** [Pathways & Networks](../_index.md)

## Overview

Regulatory network databases catalog transcription factor binding, epigenetic modifications, and gene regulatory relationships. These resources enable understanding of gene regulation and interpretation of non-coding genetic variants.

Key resources include JASPAR (transcription factor binding motifs) and Roadmap Epigenomics (chromatin state maps). Together they provide the foundation for regulatory variant interpretation.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [JASPAR](./jaspar/_index.md) | 1 | Transcription factor binding profiles |
| [Roadmap Epigenomics](./roadmap.epigenomics/_index.md) | 1 | Epigenome reference maps |

## Integration Notes

JASPAR provides position weight matrices for TF binding site prediction. Roadmap Epigenomics offers tissue-specific chromatin states. Cross-reference with ENCODE for experimental TF binding data. Use with GTEx eQTLs to connect regulatory regions to target genes.
