# Signaling Pathways

**Parent:** [Pathways & Networks](../_index.md)

## Overview

Signaling pathway databases catalog the molecular cascades involved in cellular signal transduction. These resources describe receptor-ligand interactions, kinase cascades, and transcriptional responses that mediate cellular communication.

Key resources include Pathway Commons (aggregated pathway data). Signaling pathways are also well-covered in KEGG and Reactome (see 4.1 Metabolic Pathways).

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [Pathway Commons](./\{pathwaycommons\}/_index.md) | 1 | Integrated pathway database |

## Integration Notes

Pathway Commons aggregates pathways from multiple sources in BioPAX format. For additional signaling pathway coverage, use KEGG and Reactome. Cross-reference with protein-protein interaction databases for network context. Link to GtoPdb for receptor pharmacology.
