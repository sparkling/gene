## Integration Notes

BATMAN-TCM (Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular mechANism of Traditional Chinese Medicine) predicts compound-target interactions for TCM ingredients.

**Primary use (Traditional Chinese Medicine):** TCM herb ingredients, formula composition, predicted targets, disease associations, network pharmacology.

**Secondary use (Traditional Medicine Compounds):** Compound structures, predicted bioactivities, target networks, mechanism of action predictions.

BATMAN-TCM's target prediction algorithms enable modern molecular interpretation of TCM formulas, bridging traditional knowledge with network pharmacology approaches.
