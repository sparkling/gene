## Integration Notes

HERB (High-throughput Experiment- and Reference-guided database of Traditional Chinese Medicine) integrates TCM data with high-throughput experimental validation.

**Primary use (Traditional Chinese Medicine):** TCM herbs, formulas, ingredients, targets, diseases, with emphasis on experimentally validated data.

**Secondary use (Traditional Medicine Compounds):** Validated compound-target interactions, experimental bioactivity data, network pharmacology.

HERB distinguishes itself by integrating high-throughput experimental data (transcriptomics, proteomics) with traditional TCM knowledge, enabling evidence-based TCM research.
