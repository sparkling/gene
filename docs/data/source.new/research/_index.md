# Research & Analysis

This directory contains research documents, literature reviews, and priority analyses that inform the Gene platform's evidence-based approach to genetic health optimization.

## Available Research Documents

| Document | Description | Link |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Interventions Priority List | Prioritized interventions based on evidence strength, safety, accessibility, and impact across genetic variants | [interventions-priority.md](./interventions-priority.md) |
| Literature Priority List | Key research papers, clinical studies, and systematic reviews organized by domain and evidence level | [literature-priority.md](./literature-priority.md) |

## Research Document Types

### Interventions Priority

The interventions priority document provides a comprehensive, evidence-based ranking of genetic health interventions including:

- **Lifestyle interventions** (diet, exercise, sleep, stress management)
- **Supplements & nutraceuticals** (vitamins, minerals, botanical compounds)
- **Medications** (prescription therapies with genetic considerations)
- **Environmental modifications** (toxin reduction, environmental optimization)
- **Advanced therapies** (emerging treatments, gene therapy considerations)

Each intervention is evaluated on:
- Evidence strength (clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses)
- Safety profile (side effects, contraindications, interactions)
- Accessibility (cost, availability, ease of implementation)
- Genetic specificity (which variants benefit most)
- Cross-domain impact (benefits across multiple health areas)

### Literature Priority

The literature priority document organizes key research by:

- **Evidence level** (systematic reviews, RCTs, cohort studies, case studies)
- **Domain relevance** (which health domains the research impacts)
- **Clinical applicability** (how findings translate to practice)
- **Recency** (publication date and current relevance)
- **Impact factor** (journal quality and citation metrics)

## Research Methodology

### Evidence Evaluation Framework

Research documents use a standardized framework for evaluating evidence quality:

1. **Level I** - Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs
2. **Level II** - Individual randomized controlled trials
3. **Level III** - Controlled trials without randomization
4. **Level IV** - Case-control and cohort studies
5. **Level V** - Systematic reviews of descriptive/qualitative studies
6. **Level VI** - Single descriptive or qualitative studies
7. **Level VII** - Expert opinion and consensus

### Priority Scoring

Interventions and literature are scored using a multi-factor model:

```
Priority Score = (Evidence × 0.35) + (Safety × 0.25) + (Impact × 0.25) + (Accessibility × 0.15)
```

Where each factor is scored 0-100 based on defined criteria.

## Integration with Platform

Research documents directly inform:

- **Recommendation engine** - Which interventions to suggest for specific variants
- **Evidence display** - What research to show users for each recommendation
- **Priority routing** - Which interventions appear first in user workflows
- **Safety warnings** - Which interactions and contraindications to flag
- **Content updates** - When to review and update existing recommendations

## Update Schedule

Research documents are reviewed and updated:

- **Quarterly** - New high-impact studies added
- **Annually** - Comprehensive evidence re-evaluation
- **Ad-hoc** - Major breakthroughs or safety alerts trigger immediate updates

## Contributing Research

To propose new research for inclusion:

1. Submit via platform research submission form
2. Include full citation and DOI
3. Provide brief summary of relevance
4. Note any conflicts of interest
5. Research team will evaluate and respond within 30 days

## Quality Standards

All research included must meet minimum quality criteria:

- Published in peer-reviewed journal or preprint with review
- Appropriate methodology for research question
- Adequate sample size and statistical power
- Clear reporting of limitations
- No undisclosed conflicts of interest
- Reproducible methods and data availability (when possible)

## Research Team

Research documents are maintained by the Gene platform research team, which includes:

- Genetic counselors
- Clinical geneticists
- Evidence-based medicine specialists
- Biostatisticians
- Domain-specific medical experts
