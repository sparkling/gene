# Clinical Views

**Parent:** [Data Sources](../_index.md)

Clinical perspective views that organize data sources by health condition and therapeutic area. These cross-cut the [resource/](../resource/) categories, aggregating relevant genetics, compounds, pathways, and literature sources for each clinical view.

**Purpose:** For clinicians and researchers who think "I need data about cancer" rather than "I need variant databases".

## Available Views

| View | Description | Link |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Mental & Cognitive Health | Neurodevelopmental conditions, psychiatric disorders, cognitive function, neurodegeneration | [mental-cognitive.md](./mental-cognitive.md) |
| Cardiovascular & Metabolic | Heart health, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome | [cardio-metabolic.md](./cardio-metabolic.md) |
| Cancer & Oncology | Cancer susceptibility, tumor genetics, treatment response, prevention | [cancer-oncology.md](./cancer-oncology.md) |
| Autoimmune & Inflammatory | Autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammation, immune system disorders | [autoimmune.md](./autoimmune.md) |
| Rare & Genetic Diseases | Monogenic disorders, rare diseases, genetic syndromes | [rare.md](./rare.md) |
| Women's & Pediatric Health | Reproductive health, pregnancy, pediatric conditions, developmental disorders | [womens-pediatric.md](./womens-pediatric.md) |
| Microbiome & Gut Health | Gut microbiome, digestive disorders, nutrient absorption, gut-brain axis | [microbiome.md](./microbiome.md) |
| Allergy & Pain Management | Allergies, sensitivities, pain syndromes, inflammatory pain | [allergy-pain.md](./allergy-pain.md) |
| Sleep, Longevity & Nutrition | Sleep disorders, aging, longevity pathways, nutritional genomics | [sleep-longevity-nutri.md](./sleep-longevity-nutri.md) |
| Oral, Skin & Sensory Health | Dental health, skin conditions, vision, hearing, sensory processing | [oral-skin-sensory.md](./oral-skin-sensory.md) |

## View Document Structure

Each view document typically includes:

1. **Overview** - View scope and key areas
2. **Genetic Databases** - References to relevant databases organized by application
3. **Key Genes & Variants** - Important genetic markers for the view
4. **Clinical Applications** - How genetic information is used clinically
5. **Research Focus** - Current research priorities and emerging areas
6. **Interventions** - Evidence-based interventions relevant to the view
7. **References** - Links to primary database documents

## Cross-View Considerations

Many genetic variants and interventions span views. For example:

- **Inflammation** affects cardiovascular, autoimmune, and metabolic views
- **Methylation** impacts mental health, cancer, and aging
- **Oxidative stress** relates to cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and cancer views

Users should consult multiple clinical views when researching complex conditions with multiple system involvement.

## Maintenance

Clinical views are updated when:
- New databases are added to primary storage
- Research reveals new condition-specific applications
- Clinical guidelines change for condition-specific interventions
- Cross-view relationships are identified
