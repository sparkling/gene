# Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics

**Parent:** [Compounds & Molecules](../_index.md)

## Overview

ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) databases provide data and predictions for drug-like properties. These resources support lead optimization in drug discovery and understanding of drug-drug interactions.

Key resources include SuperCYP (cytochrome P450 interactions) and SwissADME (ADMET property predictions). These complement pharmacogenomics resources in Category 1.4.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [SuperCYP](./supercyp/_index.md) | 2 | CYP450 drug metabolism database |
| [SwissADME](./swissadme/_index.md) | 2 | ADMET property prediction tool |

## Integration Notes

SuperCYP provides extensive CYP450 substrate, inhibitor, and inducer information. SwissADME offers free online ADMET predictions. Cross-reference with PharmGKB for pharmacogenomic implications of metabolizing enzyme variants. Use together with DrugBank for comprehensive metabolism pathways.
