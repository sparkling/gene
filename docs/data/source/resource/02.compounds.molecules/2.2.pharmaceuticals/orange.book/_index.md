# FDA Orange Book - Approved Drug Products

**Category:** [Compounds & Molecules](../../_index.md) > [Pharmaceuticals](../_index.md)

## Overview

The FDA Orange Book (officially "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations") is the definitive list of drug products approved by the FDA for safety and efficacy. It provides therapeutic equivalence evaluations for multisource prescription drug products, patent information, and exclusivity data critical for generic drug development.

The Orange Book is essential for the pharmaceutical industry, enabling manufacturers to identify reference listed drugs for ANDA submissions, assess patent landscapes for generic entry, and understand exclusivity periods that may delay market entry. Healthcare providers and pharmacists use therapeutic equivalence ratings to make substitution decisions.

The database is updated monthly and available in electronic format through the FDA website, with downloadable data files enabling integration with drug development and regulatory intelligence systems.
