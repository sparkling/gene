## Integration Notes

PhytoHub focuses on dietary phytochemicals and their metabolites, serving as a hub connecting compound chemistry with nutritional bioavailability data.

**Primary use (Food Compounds):** Phytochemical structures, metabolite identification, analytical standards, spectral data.

**Secondary use (Bioactive Food Compounds):** Biomarker discovery, metabolomics annotation, dietary exposure assessment.

PhytoHub is essential for identifying phytochemical metabolites in biofluid samples and connecting them to dietary sources.
