# Food Compounds and Nutrients

**Parent:** [Compounds & Molecules](../README.md)

## Overview

Food compound databases catalog bioactive molecules found in foods, including polyphenols, flavonoids, and other phytochemicals. These resources support nutritional research, food-drug interaction analysis, and understanding health effects of dietary compounds.

Key resources include Phenol-Explorer (dietary polyphenols), PhytoHub (phytochemical metabolome), and USDA FoodData (nutrient composition). These complement the broader nutrition databases in Category 6.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [Phenol-Explorer](./phenol.explorer/README.md) | 1 | Dietary polyphenol database |
| [PhytoHub](./phytohub/README.md) | 2 | Phytochemical metabolome |
| [USDA FoodData](./usda.fooddata/README.md) | 1 | National nutrient database |

## Integration Notes

Phenol-Explorer provides the most comprehensive polyphenol content data. PhytoHub links dietary compounds to their metabolites. USDA FoodData covers standard nutrients. Cross-reference with FooDB for complete food chemistry. Link compound structures to PubChem for chemical identifiers.
