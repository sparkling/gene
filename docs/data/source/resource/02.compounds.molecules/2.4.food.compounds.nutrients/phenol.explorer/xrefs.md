## Integration Notes

Phenol-Explorer is the primary database for polyphenol content in foods, bridging chemical compound data with food composition science.

**Primary use (Food Compounds):** Quantitative polyphenol content in foods, chemical structures, metabolite data, bioavailability information.

**Secondary use (Bioactive Food Compounds):** Dietary intake estimation, food-health relationships, bioactive compound identification in foods.

The database enables researchers to connect specific polyphenol compounds to their food sources and estimate dietary intake for epidemiological studies.
