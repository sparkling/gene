# Phenol-Explorer - Polyphenol Database

## Overview

Phenol-Explorer is the most comprehensive database on polyphenol content in foods and beverages. It contains detailed information on the content of over 500 polyphenol compounds in more than 400 foods, along with data on polyphenol metabolism and pharmacokinetics. The database is a critical resource for nutrition research, dietary assessment, and understanding the health effects of plant-based foods.

The database provides quantitative composition data extracted from peer-reviewed publications, covering all major polyphenol classes including flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, stilbenes, and other phenolics. Each food composition value is linked to its analytical method, allowing researchers to assess data quality and comparability.

Phenol-Explorer also includes extensive data on polyphenol metabolites found in human biofluids after consumption, supporting bioavailability studies and biomarker research.
