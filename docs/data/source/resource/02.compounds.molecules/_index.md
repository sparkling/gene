# Compounds and Molecules

**Parent:** [Data Sources](../_index.md)

## Overview

This category encompasses databases focused on chemical compounds, including natural products, pharmaceuticals, food compounds, and their interactions with biological targets. These resources provide essential chemical structure, bioactivity, and pharmacological data for drug discovery, natural product research, and nutritional science.

Chemical compound databases range from comprehensive repositories like PubChem and ChEMBL to specialized collections of natural products (LOTUS, COCONUT), traditional medicine compounds (linked to Category 5), and food-derived molecules. They support compound identification, property prediction, and target interaction analysis.

The integration of compound data with biological targets, pathways, and clinical outcomes enables rational drug design, polypharmacology analysis, and understanding of structure-activity relationships across diverse chemical spaces.
