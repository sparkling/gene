# MASI - Microbiome-Associated Signaling Interactions

**Category:** [Microbiome](../../../README.md) > [Microbe-Host Interactions](../README.md)

## Overview

MASI (Microbiome-Associated Signaling Interactions) is a database cataloging the molecular mechanisms by which gut microbiota influence host signaling pathways. It focuses on the biochemical links between microbial metabolites and host receptors, enzymes, and signaling cascades.

The database includes microbial metabolite production, host receptor interactions, downstream signaling effects, and associated physiological outcomes. It provides mechanistic detail beyond simple associations.

MASI is valuable for understanding the molecular basis of microbiome-host communication and developing microbiome-targeted therapeutics.
