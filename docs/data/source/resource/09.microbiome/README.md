# Microbiome Resources

**Parent:** [Data Sources](../README.md)

## Overview

This category contains databases focused on the human microbiome, including gut microbiota, oral microbiome, and microbe-host interactions. These resources are essential for understanding the role of microbial communities in human health and disease.

Microbiome databases integrate metagenomic sequencing data, taxonomic annotations, and phenotype associations to support research in microbiome-based therapeutics, personalized medicine, and understanding the gut-brain axis.

## Subcategories

| Subcategory | Description | Sources |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| [9.1 Gut Microbiome](./9.1.gut.microbiome/README.md) | Intestinal microbiota databases | 3 |
| [9.2 Body Site Microbiomes](./9.2.body.site.microbiomes/README.md) | Oral, skin, and other body site data | 3 |
| [9.3 Microbe-Host Interactions](./9.3.microbe.host.interactions/README.md) | Microbiome-disease and metabolic interactions | 3 |

## Key Integration Points

- **Genetics**: Link microbiome composition to host genetics
- **Nutrition**: Connect dietary patterns to microbiome changes
- **Disease**: Associate dysbiosis with disease states
- **Metabolomics**: Map microbial metabolites to host metabolome

## Research Applications

1. Microbiome-based biomarker discovery
2. Probiotic and prebiotic development
3. Drug-microbiome interaction studies
4. Personalized nutrition based on gut microbiome
5. Understanding microbiome in disease pathogenesis
