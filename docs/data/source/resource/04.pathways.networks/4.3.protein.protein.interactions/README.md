# Protein-Protein Interactions

**Parent:** [Pathways & Networks](../README.md)

## Overview

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases catalog physical and functional interactions between proteins. These resources provide the foundation for network biology, enabling analysis of protein complexes, signaling modules, and disease networks.

Key resources include STRING (functional associations), IntAct (curated interactions), and BioGRID (comprehensive interactions). Together they provide complementary views of the protein interactome.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [STRING](./string/README.md) | 1 | Functional protein associations |
| [IntAct](./intact/README.md) | 1 | Molecular interaction database |
| [BioGRID](./biogrid/README.md) | 1 | Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets |

## Integration Notes

STRING provides scored functional associations including predicted interactions. IntAct offers IMEx-compliant curated physical interactions. BioGRID aggregates genetic and physical interactions. Use confidence scores to filter interactions. Cross-reference with UniProt for protein annotations.
