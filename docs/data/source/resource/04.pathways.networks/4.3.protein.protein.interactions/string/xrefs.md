## Integration Notes

STRING (Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) integrates protein-protein interaction data from multiple sources, bridging network biology with molecular biology perspectives.

**Primary use (Protein-Protein Interactions):** Functional association networks, interaction confidence scores, network topology analysis, pathway enrichment.

**Secondary use (Molecular Interactions):** Protein function prediction, complex membership, evolutionary conservation of interactions.

STRING combines experimental data, computational predictions, text mining, and database imports to provide comprehensive protein interaction networks across species.
