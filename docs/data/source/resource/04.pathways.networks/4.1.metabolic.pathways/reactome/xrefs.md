## Integration Notes

Reactome is a comprehensive, manually curated pathway database covering metabolism, signaling, and disease pathways. It appears in multiple taxonomy locations due to its broad coverage.

**Primary use (Metabolic Pathways):** Detailed metabolic pathway models, enzyme-substrate relationships, small molecule transformations.

**Secondary use (Signaling Pathways):** Signal transduction cascades, receptor-ligand interactions, transcriptional regulation.

**Tertiary use (Molecular Interactions):** Protein complexes, reaction participants, functional relationships.

Reactome's detailed mechanistic models enable pathway analysis, enrichment testing, and systems biology applications across metabolic and signaling domains.
