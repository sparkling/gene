## Integration Notes

KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) provides comprehensive pathway maps covering metabolism, signaling, and disease processes.

**Primary use (Metabolic Pathways):** Metabolic pathway maps, enzyme reactions, compound transformations, metabolic network topology.

**Secondary use (Signaling Pathways):** Signal transduction pathways, cellular processes, organismal systems, disease pathways.

KEGG's integrated approach connecting genes, compounds, reactions, and pathways makes it essential for systems-level understanding of both metabolic and signaling processes.
