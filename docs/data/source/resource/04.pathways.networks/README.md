# Pathways and Networks

**Parent:** [Data Sources](../README.md)

## Overview

This category encompasses databases describing biological pathways, molecular interaction networks, and functional gene annotations. These resources provide the context for understanding how genes, proteins, and compounds work together in biological systems.

Pathway databases include metabolic pathways (KEGG, Reactome), signaling cascades, and regulatory networks. Interaction databases catalog protein-protein interactions (STRING, BioGRID, IntAct), drug-target relationships (STITCH), and transcription factor binding (JASPAR). Gene ontology resources provide standardized functional annotations.

The integration of pathway and network data with genetic variants, expression changes, and compound perturbations enables pathway enrichment analysis, network-based disease gene prioritization, and systems-level understanding of biological processes.

## Key Integration Points

- **Genetics**: Map variants to affected pathways for enrichment analysis
- **Compounds**: Connect drugs to pathway perturbations
- **Diseases**: Identify dysregulated pathways in disease states
- **Expression**: Overlay gene expression on pathway diagrams
- **Proteins**: Link pathway members to structures and functions

## Research Applications

1. Pathway enrichment analysis for gene sets
2. Network-based disease gene prioritization
3. Drug mechanism of action elucidation
4. Systems biology modeling
5. Transcriptional regulatory network inference
6. Metabolic flux analysis
