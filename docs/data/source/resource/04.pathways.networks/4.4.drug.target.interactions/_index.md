# Drug-Target Interactions

**Parent:** [Pathways & Networks](../_index.md)

## Overview

Drug-target interaction databases extend protein interaction networks to include small molecule compounds. These resources enable polypharmacology analysis and understanding of drug mechanisms through network context.

Key resources include STITCH (chemical-protein interaction network). For additional compound-target data, see Category 2.7 (Compound-Target Interactions).

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [STITCH](./\{stitch\}/_index.md) | 1 | Chemical-protein interaction network |

## Integration Notes

STITCH extends STRING to include chemical-protein interactions. Interactions are scored by confidence. Cross-reference with BindingDB and DrugBank for binding affinities. Use together with STRING for integrated drug-target-protein networks.
