## Integration Notes

OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) is the authoritative compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes, bridging phenotype databases with rare disease resources.

**Primary use (Phenotype Databases):** Mendelian disease phenotypes, gene-phenotype relationships, clinical features, inheritance patterns.

**Secondary use (Rare/Orphan Diseases):** Rare genetic disorders, disease entries (phenotype MIM numbers), gene entries (gene MIM numbers).

OMIM's curated content and unique numbering system (MIM numbers) make it essential for rare disease diagnosis, genetic counseling, and clinical genetics research.
