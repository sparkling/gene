# Phenotype Databases

**Parent:** [Diseases & Phenotypes](../README.md)

## Overview

Phenotype databases catalog the observable characteristics and clinical features associated with diseases and genetic conditions. These resources are essential for phenotype-driven diagnosis, particularly in rare disease settings.

Key resources include HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) for standardized phenotype terms, OMIM (mendelian inheritance), and Orphanet phenotypes. Together they enable computational phenotype matching and differential diagnosis.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [HPO](./hpo/README.md) | 1 | Human Phenotype Ontology |
| [OMIM](./omim/README.md) | 1 | Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man |
| [Orphanet Phenotypes](./orphanet.phenotypes/README.md) | 1 | Rare disease phenotype annotations |

## Integration Notes

HPO provides the standard vocabulary for clinical phenotypes. OMIM offers detailed gene-phenotype relationships for Mendelian conditions. Orphanet focuses on rare disease phenotypes. Use HPO terms for phenotype matching algorithms. Cross-reference with ClinVar for variant-phenotype links.
