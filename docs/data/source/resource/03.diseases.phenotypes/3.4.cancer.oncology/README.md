# Cancer and Oncology

**Parent:** [Diseases & Phenotypes](../README.md)

## Overview

Cancer and oncology databases provide clinical and genomic data from cancer patients and studies. These resources complement the cancer genomics databases in Category 1.6 by focusing on clinical outcomes, trial data, and integrated tumor characterization.

Key resources include GDC/TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas via Genomic Data Commons). For additional cancer genomic resources, see Category 1.6 (Cancer Genomics).

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [GDC/TCGA](./\{gdc.tcga\}/README.md) | 1 | Genomic Data Commons / TCGA |

## Integration Notes

GDC provides access to TCGA and other NCI cancer genomics projects with clinical annotations. Cross-reference with COSMIC and cBioPortal for somatic mutation data. Link to ClinicalTrials.gov for intervention studies. See Category 1.6 for additional cancer genomics resources.
