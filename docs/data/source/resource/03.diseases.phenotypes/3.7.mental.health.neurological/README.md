# Mental Health and Neurological

**Parent:** [Diseases & Phenotypes](../README.md)

## Overview

Mental health and neurological databases focus on psychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain function. These resources catalog genetic associations, brain expression data, and synaptic biology relevant to neuropsychiatric conditions.

Key resources include Allen Brain Atlas (brain transcriptomics), PGC (psychiatric genetics), and SynGO (synaptic gene ontology). Together they support neuropsychiatric research and brain biology understanding.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [Allen Brain Atlas](./allen.brain.atlas/README.md) | 1 | Brain gene expression maps |
| [PGC](./pgc/README.md) | 1 | Psychiatric Genomics Consortium |
| [SynGO](./syngo/README.md) | 2 | Synaptic Gene Ontology |

## Integration Notes

Allen Brain Atlas provides spatial and cell-type-specific brain expression. PGC offers the largest psychiatric GWAS summary statistics. SynGO annotates genes with synaptic functions. Cross-reference with GTEx for brain tissue eQTLs. Link to DrugBank for CNS-active drug targets.
