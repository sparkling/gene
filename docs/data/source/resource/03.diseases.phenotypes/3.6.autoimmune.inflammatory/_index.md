# Autoimmune and Inflammatory

**Parent:** [Diseases & Phenotypes](../_index.md)

## Overview

Autoimmune and inflammatory disease databases focus on immune-mediated conditions including autoimmune diseases, allergies, and chronic inflammatory disorders. These resources catalog genetic associations, HLA types, and immunological features.

Key resources include ImmunoBase (immune-mediated disease genetics) and IPD-IMGT/HLA (HLA allele database). Together they support immunogenetics research and understanding immune disease mechanisms.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [ImmunoBase](./immunobase/_index.md) | 2 | Immune disease genetics |
| [IPD-IMGT/HLA](./ipd.imgt.hla/_index.md) | 1 | HLA allele database |

## Integration Notes

ImmunoBase aggregates GWAS data for 12+ immune-mediated diseases. IPD-IMGT/HLA provides the authoritative HLA nomenclature and allele sequences. Cross-reference with GWAS Catalog for additional immune disease associations. Link HLA types to pharmacogenomics for drug hypersensitivity.
