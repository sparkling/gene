# Disease-Gene Associations

**Parent:** [Diseases & Phenotypes](../_index.md)

## Overview

Disease-gene association databases aggregate evidence linking genes to diseases from multiple sources including genetics, literature, and functional data. These resources support target identification, drug repurposing, and understanding disease mechanisms.

Key resources include DisGeNET (comprehensive gene-disease associations) and Open Targets (platform integrating genetics, drugs, and diseases). Together they provide scored disease-gene relationships with evidence attribution.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [DisGeNET](./disgenet/_index.md) | 1 | Gene-disease association database |
| [Open Targets](./open.targets/_index.md) | 1 | Target identification platform |

## Integration Notes

DisGeNET provides scored associations from curated and text-mined sources. Open Targets integrates genetics, expression, and drug data for target prioritization. Both use standardized disease ontologies. Cross-reference with GWAS Catalog for genetic evidence and DrugBank for therapeutic implications.
