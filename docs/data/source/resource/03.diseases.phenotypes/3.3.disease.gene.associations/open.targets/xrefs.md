## Integration Notes

Open Targets Platform integrates evidence for target-disease associations to support drug discovery.

**Primary use (Disease-Gene Associations):** Target-disease association scores, evidence from genetics, literature, animal models, expression.

**Secondary use (Drug-Target Interactions):** Druggability assessments, known drug-target relationships, clinical pipeline data, safety liabilities.

Open Targets combines data from 20+ sources to provide comprehensive target validation evidence, essential for prioritizing drug targets in disease contexts.
