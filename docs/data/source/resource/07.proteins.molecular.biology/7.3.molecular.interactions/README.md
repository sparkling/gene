# Molecular Interaction Databases

**Parent:** [Proteins and Molecular Biology](../README.md)

## Overview

Molecular interaction databases catalog physical and functional associations between proteins and other biomolecules. These resources are essential for understanding cellular networks and systems biology.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [IntAct](./intact/) | 1 | Molecular interaction database (symlink to pathways) |
| [Reactome](./reactome/) | 1 | Pathway database (symlink to pathways) |
| [STRING](./string/) | 1 | Protein-protein interaction networks (symlink to pathways) |

## Integration Notes

Primary molecular interaction data is maintained in the Pathways category. This subcategory provides convenient cross-references for protein-centric workflows. See [04.pathways.networks](../../04.pathways.networks/README.md) for full documentation.
