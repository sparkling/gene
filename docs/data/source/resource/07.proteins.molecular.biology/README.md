# Proteins and Molecular Biology

**Parent:** [Data Sources](../_index.md)

## Overview

This category contains databases focused on protein sequences, annotations, and three-dimensional structures. These resources form the backbone of molecular biology research, enabling understanding of protein function, evolution, and drug targeting.

Protein databases provide comprehensive information from amino acid sequences to experimentally determined and computationally predicted 3D structures. This data is essential for structure-based drug design, understanding disease mechanisms at the molecular level, and annotating newly sequenced genomes.

## Subcategories

| Subcategory | Description | Sources |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| [7.1 Protein Sequences & Annotations](./7.1.protein.sequences.annotations/_index.md) | Curated protein sequence databases | 2 |
| [7.2 Protein Structures](./7.2.protein.structures/_index.md) | Experimental and predicted 3D structures | 3 |
| [7.3 Molecular Interactions](./7.3.molecular.interactions/_index.md) | Protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions | (symlinks) |

## Key Integration Points

- **Genetics**: Map variants to protein sequences via RefSeq, UniProt
- **Compounds**: Link drug targets via structure-based analysis
- **Pathways**: Connect proteins to pathway roles in KEGG, Reactome
- **Disease**: Associate protein dysfunction with disease phenotypes

## Research Applications

1. Structure-based drug design
2. Protein function prediction
3. Variant effect interpretation
4. Enzyme mechanism studies
5. Evolutionary analysis
