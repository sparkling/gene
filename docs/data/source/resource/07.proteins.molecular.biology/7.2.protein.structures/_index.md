# Protein Structure Databases

**Parent:** [Proteins and Molecular Biology](../_index.md)

## Overview

Protein structure databases contain three-dimensional atomic coordinates of proteins determined experimentally (X-ray, cryo-EM, NMR) or computationally predicted. These resources are essential for structure-based drug design, understanding molecular mechanisms, and protein engineering.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [AlphaFold DB](./alphafold.db/_index.md) | 1 | AI-predicted protein structures |
| [PDB](./pdb/_index.md) | 1 | Protein Data Bank - experimental structures |
| [SWISS-MODEL](./swiss.model/_index.md) | 2 | Automated protein homology modeling |

## Integration Notes

PDB is the authoritative source for experimental structures. AlphaFold DB provides high-confidence predictions for proteins lacking experimental structures. SWISS-MODEL offers homology-based models. Use in combination for maximum coverage.
