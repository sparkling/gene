# Genetics and Genomics

**Parent:** [Data Sources](../_index.md)

## Overview

This category encompasses databases and resources related to genetic variation, functional genomics, and their relationships to human health and disease. These resources form the foundation for understanding how genetic variants influence phenotypes, drug responses, and disease susceptibility.

Genetics and genomics databases range from comprehensive variant repositories like ClinVar and dbSNP to specialized resources for population genetics (gnomAD, 1000 Genomes), pharmacogenomics (PharmGKB, CPIC), and cancer genomics (COSMIC, OncoKB). Together they enable variant interpretation, disease gene discovery, and precision medicine applications.

The resources in this category are essential for clinical variant classification, genome-wide association studies, pharmacogenomic testing, and understanding the molecular basis of inherited and somatic diseases.

## Key Integration Points

- **Compounds**: Link variants to drug metabolism via PharmGKB, CPIC
- **Diseases**: Associate variants with conditions via ClinVar, OMIM
- **Pathways**: Connect variants to affected pathways via Reactome, KEGG
- **Literature**: Cross-reference with PubMed for evidence support

## Research Applications

1. Clinical variant interpretation and classification
2. Pharmacogenomic dosing recommendations
3. Cancer driver gene identification
4. Population genetic structure analysis
5. Gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping
6. Functional variant effect prediction
