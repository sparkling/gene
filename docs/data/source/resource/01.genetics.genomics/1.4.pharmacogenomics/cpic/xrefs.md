## Integration Notes

CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium) provides peer-reviewed clinical guidelines for pharmacogenomic implementation.

**Primary use (Pharmacogenomics):** Evidence-based dosing guidelines, gene-drug pairs, allele functionality assignments, phenotype-genotype translations.

**Secondary use (Drug Metabolism/PK):** Clinical implementation of metabolizer phenotypes, actionable PGx variants, therapeutic recommendations.

CPIC guidelines are the gold standard for translating pharmacogenomic test results into clinical action, essential for precision medicine implementation.
