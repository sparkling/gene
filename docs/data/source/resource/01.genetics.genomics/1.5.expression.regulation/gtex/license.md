# GTEx License Terms

License details for GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) data usage.

## Quick Reference

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| License | Open Access (aggregate); dbGaP Agreement (individual) |
| SPDX Identifier | Custom |
| Commercial Use | Per dbGaP terms (individual data) |
| Attribution Required | Yes |
| Redistribution | Yes (aggregate); No (individual) |

## Summary

GTEx has two access tiers. Aggregate data (expression matrices, eQTL summary statistics, sample metadata) is openly accessible without registration. Individual-level data (genotypes, raw sequence data) requires dbGaP authorization. The open access data is under NIH Genomic Data Sharing policy principles.

---

## Permissions

What you CAN do with this data:

- Download open access aggregate data without restriction
- Use expression matrices for research
- Integrate eQTL data into GWAS interpretation
- Use for commercial applications (aggregate data)
- Publish analyses with proper citation

---

## Restrictions

What you CANNOT do without additional permission:

- Access individual-level data without dbGaP approval
- Redistribute individual-level data
- Attempt to re-identify donors
- Use individual data beyond approved research scope

## Special Terms

### Access Tiers

| Data Type | Access | Requirements |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
