## Summary

ENCODE data is freely available under an open access model following the ENCODE Data Use Policy. All released data can be used for any purpose including commercial applications. No registration is required for data access. Users are expected to cite ENCODE appropriately.

---

## Permissions

What you CAN do with this data:

- Use for academic and commercial research
- Download any released data without restriction
- Integrate into commercial products
- Redistribute with attribution
- Create derivative databases and annotations

---

What you CANNOT do without additional permission:

- Use data before official release (embargo period)
- Claim as original work without attribution

## Special Terms

### Data Release Tiers

| Status | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Released | Publicly available | Unrestricted |
| In Progress | Not yet released | Not accessible |
| Archived | Superseded version | Use with caution |
| Revoked | Quality issues | Do not use |

### Nine-Month Rule (Historical)

Early ENCODE phases had a 9-month exclusivity period for data producers. This no longer applies to current releases - all released data is immediately available.

### Experimental Data vs Annotations

Both raw experimental data and derived annotations (like cCREs) are available under the same open access terms.
