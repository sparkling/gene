## Integration Notes

COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) is the comprehensive resource for somatic mutation data in human cancer.

**Primary use (Cancer Genomics):** Somatic mutations in cancer, mutation frequencies, cancer gene census, mutational signatures.

**Secondary use (Cancer Oncology):** Tumor types, driver mutations, drug resistance mutations, actionable targets.

COSMIC aggregates somatic mutation data from the scientific literature and large-scale cancer genome projects, essential for cancer variant interpretation.
