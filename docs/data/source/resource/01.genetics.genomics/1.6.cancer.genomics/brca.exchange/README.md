# BRCA Exchange

**Category:** [Genetics & Genomics](../../_index.md) > [Cancer Genomics](../_index.md)

## Overview

BRCA Exchange is a comprehensive resource for BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant data aggregation and classification. As part of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), it brings together data from clinical laboratories, research databases, and population resources to provide expert-reviewed classifications for variants in these critical cancer predisposition genes.

The database aggregates variant classifications from ClinVar, LOVD, ENIGMA consortium, and other sources, providing a unified view of clinical significance with expert review. The ENIGMA consortium provides the most authoritative classifications based on extensive functional and clinical evidence.

BRCA Exchange is essential for clinical laboratories interpreting BRCA variants, genetic counselors, and researchers studying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.
