# Cancer Genomics

**Parent:** [Genetics & Genomics](../README.md)

## Overview

Cancer genomics databases catalog somatic mutations, driver genes, and actionable variants specific to cancer. These resources support precision oncology through tumor variant interpretation, driver identification, and clinical actionability assessment.

Key resources include COSMIC (comprehensive somatic mutations), OncoKB (clinical actionability), CIViC (clinical interpretations), cBioPortal (cancer study data), and the Cancer Gene Census. BRCA Exchange focuses on hereditary cancer variants.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [COSMIC](./cosmic/README.md) | 1 | Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer |
| [OncoKB](./oncokb/README.md) | 1 | Precision oncology knowledge base |
| [CIViC](./civic/README.md) | 1 | Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer |
| [cBioPortal](./cbioportal/README.md) | 1 | Cancer genomics data portal |
| [Cancer Gene Census](./cancer.gene.census/README.md) | 1 | Cancer driver gene catalog |
| [BRCA Exchange](./brca.exchange/README.md) | 1 | BRCA1/2 variant database |

## Integration Notes

COSMIC provides the largest somatic variant collection. OncoKB and CIViC offer clinical actionability evidence. cBioPortal provides study-level data access. Cancer Gene Census defines driver genes. Cross-reference variants across sources for comprehensive annotation.
