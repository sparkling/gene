# OncoKB

**Category:** [Genetics & Genomics](../../_index.md) > [Cancer Genomics](../_index.md)

## Overview

OncoKB is a precision oncology knowledge base developed by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. It provides expert-curated annotation of the biological and clinical effects of cancer variants, linking alterations to cancer types, therapeutic implications, and clinical evidence levels.

Each variant annotation includes functional effect classification (oncogenic, likely oncogenic, etc.), associated cancer types, and therapeutic implications with FDA/guideline-based evidence levels (1-4). OncoKB covers mutations, copy number alterations, fusions, and tumor mutational burden across hundreds of genes.

OncoKB is integrated into clinical molecular tumor boards and commercial molecular profiling platforms. The FDA has recognized OncoKB as a public tumor mutation database supporting clinical decision-making.
