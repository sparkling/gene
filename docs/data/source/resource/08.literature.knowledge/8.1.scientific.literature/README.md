| [PubMed](./pubmed/README.md) | 1 | NCBI biomedical literature database |
| [PubMed Central](./pubmed.central/README.md) | 1 | Full-text article archive |
| [Semantic Scholar](./semantic.scholar/README.md) | 2 | AI-powered research discovery |

## Integration Notes

PubMed is the primary index for biomedical literature. PMC provides full-text access. Europe PMC extends coverage with patents and grants. OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar add citation analysis and AI features.
