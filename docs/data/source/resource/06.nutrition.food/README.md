# Nutrition and Food Sciences

**Parent:** [Data Sources](../README.md)

## Overview

This category encompasses data sources related to food composition, dietary supplements, bioactive food compounds, and human metabolomics. These resources are essential for understanding the relationships between diet, nutrition, and health outcomes.

Food and nutrition databases provide comprehensive information about the chemical composition of foods, the effects of dietary supplements, and the metabolic pathways involved in nutrient processing. This data supports research in nutritional genomics, personalized nutrition, and dietary intervention studies.

## Subcategories

| Subcategory | Description | Sources |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| [6.1 Food Composition](./6.1.food.composition/README.md) | Chemical composition and nutritional content of foods | 2 |
| [6.2 Dietary Supplements](./6.2.dietary.supplements/README.md) | Supplement product data and efficacy information | 3 |
| [6.3 Bioactive Food Compounds](./6.3.bioactive.food.compounds/README.md) | Phytochemicals and bioactive molecules in foods | 1 |
| [6.4 Metabolomics](./6.4.metabolomics/README.md) | Human metabolome and exposome data | 2 |

## Key Integration Points

- **Compounds**: Link food compounds to ChEMBL, PubChem for molecular data
- **Pathways**: Connect to KEGG, Reactome for metabolic pathway analysis
- **Genetics**: Associate with gene-nutrient interactions via GWAS data
- **Traditional Medicine**: Cross-reference with herbal medicine databases

## Research Applications

1. Nutritional genomics and personalized diet recommendations
2. Food-drug interaction analysis
3. Dietary intervention study design
4. Metabolic health assessment
5. Food safety and composition analysis
