# Bioactive Food Compound Databases

**Parent:** [Nutrition and Food Sciences](../_index.md)

## Overview

Bioactive food compound databases focus on non-nutrient compounds in foods that have biological effects, including polyphenols, flavonoids, and other phytochemicals. These resources support research in functional foods and nutraceuticals.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [eBASIS](./ebasis/_index.md) | 2 | Bioactive substances in food information system |
| [Phenol-Explorer](./phenol.explorer/) | 1 | Polyphenol database (symlink) |
| [PhytoHub](./phytohub/) | 2 | Dietary phytochemical database (symlink) |

## Integration Notes

eBASIS provides broad bioactive compound coverage while Phenol-Explorer and PhytoHub specialize in polyphenols and phytochemicals respectively. Cross-reference with ChEMBL for bioactivity data.
