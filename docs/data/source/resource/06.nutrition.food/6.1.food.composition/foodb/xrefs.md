## Integration Notes

FooDB is the comprehensive food constituent database, bridging food composition data with compound chemistry.

**Primary use (Food Composition):** Foods and their constituents, food groups, health effects, flavor associations, food sources.

**Secondary use (Food Compounds):** Compound structures, chemical classes, concentration data, metabolomics integration.

FooDB links 28,000+ compounds to their food sources with concentration data, making it essential for connecting dietary intake to molecular-level food chemistry.
