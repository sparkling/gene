# Food Composition Databases

**Parent:** [Nutrition and Food Sciences](../_index.md)

## Overview

Food composition databases provide detailed chemical and nutritional information about foods, including macronutrients, micronutrients, and thousands of non-nutrient compounds. These resources support dietary analysis, food labeling, and nutritional research.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [FooDB](./foodb/_index.md) | 1 | Comprehensive food compound database |
| [Open Food Facts](./open.food.facts/_index.md) | 2 | Crowdsourced food product database |
| [USDA FoodData](./usda.fooddata/) | 1 | US national nutrient database (symlink) |

## Integration Notes

These databases provide complementary coverage: FooDB focuses on food chemistry, Open Food Facts on commercial products, and USDA FoodData on standard reference nutrients.
