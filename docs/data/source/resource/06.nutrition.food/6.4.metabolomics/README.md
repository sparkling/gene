# Metabolomics Databases

**Parent:** [Nutrition and Food Sciences](../README.md)

## Overview

Metabolomics databases catalog endogenous and exogenous metabolites found in human biological samples. These resources are essential for understanding metabolism, identifying biomarkers, and studying the exposome (environmental exposures).

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [Exposome-Explorer](./exposome.explorer/README.md) | 2 | Dietary and environmental biomarkers database |
| [HMDB](./hmdb/README.md) | 1 | Human Metabolome Database |

## Integration Notes

HMDB provides comprehensive human metabolite data while Exposome-Explorer focuses on exposure biomarkers. Link to KEGG and Reactome for metabolic pathway context.
