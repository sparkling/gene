# Dietary Supplement Databases

**Parent:** [Nutrition and Food Sciences](../README.md)

## Overview

Dietary supplement databases provide information about supplement products, their ingredients, efficacy, and safety profiles. These resources are essential for understanding the composition and effects of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary supplements.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [ConsumerLab](./consumerlab/README.md) | 3 | Independent supplement testing and reviews |
| [DSLD](./dsld/README.md) | 1 | NIH Dietary Supplement Label Database |
| [Natural Medicines](./natural.medicines/README.md) | 2 | Evidence-based natural products database |

## Integration Notes

DSLD provides product label data, Natural Medicines offers evidence-based efficacy information, and ConsumerLab provides independent quality testing. Together they enable comprehensive supplement evaluation.
