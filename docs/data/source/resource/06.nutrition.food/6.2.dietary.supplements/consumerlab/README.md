# ConsumerLab

**Category:** [Nutrition](../../../README.md) > [Dietary Supplements](../README.md)

## Overview

ConsumerLab is an independent organization that tests health and nutrition products. It provides detailed quality evaluations of dietary supplements, functional foods, and personal care products, verifying whether products contain what labels claim and checking for contamination.

The service includes product reviews with test results, ingredient comparisons, and clinical evidence assessments. ConsumerLab tests for identity, potency, purity, and bioavailability of active ingredients, as well as potential contaminants like heavy metals and pesticides.

ConsumerLab is particularly valuable for quality assurance research, supplement product comparisons, and evidence-based supplement selection. Note that full access requires a subscription.
