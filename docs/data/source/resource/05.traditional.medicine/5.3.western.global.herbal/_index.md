# Western and Global Herbal Medicine

**Parent:** [Traditional Medicine](../_index.md)

## Overview

Western and global herbal medicine databases document medicinal plant use in Western traditions, regulatory assessments, and worldwide ethnobotanical knowledge. These resources bridge traditional herbal knowledge with modern evidence-based evaluation.

Key resources include NAPRALERT (natural products alert) and EMA Herbal (European Medicines Agency herbal monographs). Together they provide both comprehensive ethnobotanical data and regulatory-level assessments.

## Integration Notes
