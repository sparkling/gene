## Permissions

What you CAN do with this data:

- Use REST API for academic research
- Access docking scores and binding predictions
- Query formula-compound-protein relationships
- Publish research with citation
- Build academic analysis tools using the API

---

## Restrictions

What you CANNOT do without additional permission:

- Commercial use without agreement
- Bulk redistribution of docking data
- Commercial services based on KampoDB

## Special Terms

### API Access

The REST API is freely accessible without authentication. Rate limiting may apply; implement appropriate delays.

### Docking Data

Over 3 million docking simulations are included. Binding affinity predictions should be validated experimentally for drug development.

### Gene ID Mapping

Protein targets use NCBI Gene IDs. Manual mapping to UniProt may be required for integration.
