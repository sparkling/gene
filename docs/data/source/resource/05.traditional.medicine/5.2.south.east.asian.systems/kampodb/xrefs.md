## Integration Notes

KampoDB focuses on Japanese Kampo medicines (traditional Japanese medicine derived from Chinese medicine but adapted over centuries).

**Primary use (South/East Asian Systems):** Kampo formulas, crude drug compositions, clinical indications (Sho diagnosis), evidence levels.

**Secondary use (Traditional Medicine Compounds):** Constituent compounds, pharmacological targets, compound-formula relationships.

KampoDB bridges Japanese traditional medicine with modern pharmacology, documenting the evidence base for Kampo prescriptions covered by Japanese health insurance.
