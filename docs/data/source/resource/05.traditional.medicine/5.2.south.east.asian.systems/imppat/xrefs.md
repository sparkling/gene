## Integration Notes

IMPPAT (Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry And Therapeutics) bridges Ayurvedic/traditional Indian medicine with modern phytochemistry.

**Primary use (South/East Asian Systems):** Indian medicinal plants, Ayurvedic formulations, traditional therapeutic uses, Rasa (taste), Guna (properties).

**Secondary use (Natural Products):** Phytochemical constituents, plant-compound relationships, bioactivity predictions, drug-likeness.

IMPPAT enables integration of Ayurvedic knowledge with modern drug discovery by linking traditional plant uses to specific phytochemicals and their predicted targets.
