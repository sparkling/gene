## Special Terms

### Experimental Validation

All compounds in NPACT have experimentally tested anti-cancer activity. This distinguishes it from prediction-based databases.

### Activity Data

IC50/EC50 values come from diverse assays and cell lines. Heterogeneity should be considered when comparing values.

### Indian Plant Focus

NPACT has strong coverage of Ayurvedic and Indian medicinal plants, making it valuable for ethnobotanical research.
