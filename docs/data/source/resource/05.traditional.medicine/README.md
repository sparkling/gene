# Traditional Medicine

**Parent:** [Data Sources](../README.md)

## Overview

This category encompasses databases documenting traditional medicine systems from around the world, including Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, Kampo (Japanese traditional medicine), and Western herbal medicine. These resources catalog medicinal plants, formulations, their constituent compounds, and traditional therapeutic applications.

Traditional medicine databases bridge ancient healing knowledge with modern molecular science by linking herbal remedies to their bioactive compounds, molecular targets, and potential mechanisms of action. Resources like TCMID, TCMSP, IMPPAT, and NAPRALERT provide structured data on thousands of medicinal plants and traditional formulations.

The integration of traditional medicine data with compound databases, target prediction tools, and disease annotations enables evidence-based evaluation of traditional remedies, drug discovery from natural products, and understanding the molecular basis of traditional therapeutic practices.

## Key Integration Points

- **Compounds**: Link herbal ingredients to PubChem, ChEMBL structures
- **Targets**: Connect compounds to predicted and validated targets
- **Diseases**: Map traditional indications to modern disease ontologies
- **Pathways**: Associate formulations with affected biological pathways
- **Literature**: Cross-reference with ethnobotanical and pharmacological studies

## Research Applications

1. Natural product drug discovery from traditional remedies
2. Evidence-based evaluation of herbal medicines
3. Target prediction for traditional medicine compounds
4. Network pharmacology of traditional formulations
5. Standardization and quality control of herbal products
6. Cross-cultural comparison of traditional medicine systems
