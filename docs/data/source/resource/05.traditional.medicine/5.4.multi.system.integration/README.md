# Multi-System Integration

**Parent:** [Traditional Medicine](../README.md)

## Overview

Multi-system integration databases provide unified access to traditional medicine knowledge across multiple healing traditions. These resources enable comparative analysis and bridge different traditional medicine systems through shared compounds and therapeutic concepts.

Key resources include HIT 2.0 (Herbal Ingredients' Targets) which integrates herb-compound-target data across multiple traditional medicine systems.

## Data Sources

| Source | Tier | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [HIT 2.0](./\{hit.2.0\}/README.md) | 2 | Herbal Ingredients' Targets database |

## Integration Notes

HIT 2.0 provides cross-system herb-compound-target integration. Use for comparative analysis of herbal medicines across TCM, Ayurveda, and other traditions. Cross-reference with LOTUS and COCONUT for natural product structures. Link targets to UniProt for protein annotations.
