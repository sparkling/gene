## TL;DR

Three-phase launch strategy: (1) Private beta with 100 Phoenix Rising members, (2) Community launch to broader chronic illness community, (3) Expansion to adjacent segments. Critical success factor: claim THREE WORLDS territory before competitors notice. Launch with TCM/Ayurveda herb databases as unique differentiator. Contingency plans for competitor response and technical issues.
