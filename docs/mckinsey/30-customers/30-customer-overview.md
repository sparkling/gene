## TL;DR

The platform serves "the unhelped" — people failed by conventional medicine seeking answers through genetics and traditional healing. This is a four-sided marketplace connecting Clients (demand) with Knowledge, Practitioners, Creators, and Each Other (supply). Primary beachhead is chronic illness warriors; expansion targets biohackers, parents, and preventive health seekers.
