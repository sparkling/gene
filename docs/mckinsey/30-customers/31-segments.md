## TL;DR

Seven primary user segments identified, with "Chronic Illness Warriors" as the beachhead. This segment offers highest motivation, concentrated communities, and vocal advocacy. Secondary segments (biohackers, parents, preventive seekers) expand TAM but require different positioning. Practitioner segment (B2B) deferred to Phase 3 to avoid two-front launch complexity.

## Selection Rationale

### Why Chronic Illness as Beachhead?

| Factor | Chronic Illness | Biohackers | Comparison |
|--------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| **Motivation** | 10/10 (desperation) | 7/10 (curiosity) | +3 |
| **Community Concentration** | 9/10 (Phoenix Rising) | 7/10 (dispersed) | +2 |
| **Advocacy** | 10/10 (share everything) | 6/10 (gatekeeping) | +4 |
| **Founder Empathy** | 10/10 (lived experience) | 5/10 (different journey) | +5 |

**Strategic Logic:**
1. **Motivation drives conversion** — Desperate users convert at 3-5x rate
2. **Concentrated communities** — Phoenix Rising has 50K+ active members
3. **Vocal advocacy** — One success story = 10+ referrals
4. **Founder fit** — Authentic messaging, deep understanding

### Why NOT Biohackers First?

- More fragmented (no single community)
- Higher skepticism (been marketed to heavily)
- Different language (optimization vs healing)
- Can expand to later with adjusted positioning
