### Why Beachhead Strategy?

| Factor | Beachhead (ME/CFS) | Broad Launch |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Product-market fit | Proven pain point | Diluted messaging |
| Word-of-mouth | Tight-knit community | Fragmented |
| Competition | No one focused | SelfDecode, etc. |
| Feedback loops | Rapid iteration | Slow, noisy |
| Resource efficiency | Focused spend | Scattered CAC |

**Geoffrey Moore's Crossing the Chasm**: Start with a segment you can dominate completely, then expand.

| NPS | >50 | >60 | >70 |
| CAC | $30 | $25 | $20 |
| LTV | $150 | $175 | $200 |

## Competitive Response Plan

### If SelfDecode Enters Traditional Medicine

| Scenario | Trigger | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| They add Ayurveda doshas | Press release or feature launch | Accelerate TCM launch, emphasize depth |
| They add TCM basics | Feature comparison shows overlap | Community testimonials, practitioner validation |
| They announce major funding | Series A/B announcement | Focus on community stickiness, grassroots |

### Defensive Moats

1. **Community**: Network effects are hard to replicate
2. **Traditional medicine depth**: Data curation takes years
3. **Practitioner relationships**: Switching costs
4. **Content library**: SEO compound effects
