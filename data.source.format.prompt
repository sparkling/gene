we need to migrate all of the content in source.new into these new data source folders. Analyse all the types of data available in soruce.new, and create
  a template for how to organise the files, filenames, and file contents. Include a CLAUDE.md template that contains only core information about each data source
  that is optimised for AI and LLMs to be loaded into the context, but take care not to load too much into the context. Also have a README.md.
